# Project 3 Evaluation

## Back-end Technology
**3: Performing**
>Includes 2 models

Your back-end overall looks great. The fact that y'all did authorization with JWT is really impressive and brings this up to a 3. I would have really liked to see you organize your Express app a little better. You have all your routes in your `index.js` file rather than breaking them out into different router files, for instance. Otherwise, y'all did great.

## Front-end Technology
**2: Performing**
>Front-end makes appropriate use of React components and views with React Router.

Your front-end is overall in really good shape. You should consider organizing your components into a `components/` directory.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

The overall code quality here is great!

## Deployment and Functionality
**2: Performing**
>Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**3: Excelling**
>Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of proper teamwork, such as feature branching, code review, github issue / user story tracking, and justification of technical decisions.

It looks like y'all did a really impressive job working together. Your GitHub Project board is really thorough and your planning on the whiteboards is really comprehensive!
